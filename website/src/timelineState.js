// What a Timeline row IS, in one word — and the one place that decides it.
//
// The row used to answer this with three overlapping controls: a dot for state, a chip for the
// verdict, and a "needs you" pill that outranked both. Two rows in the same situation could
// therefore read differently depending on which of the three happened to win, and the column as
// a whole was a wall of coloured pills with no single loud thing in it.
//
// So: ONE state per row, from the seven below. It renders as a small mark, its word in quiet
// type, and the card's left edge in the state's colour — colour identifies, it never tints a
// surface, and oxblood is still spent on nothing but "this is on you".
//
// Pure and dependency-free — no theme import, so it runs under bare node
// (test/timelineState.test.mjs) and the Board can read the same table later. Colour is named by
// ROLE, not by hex: theme.jsx stays the only place a colour is chosen and this file cannot drift
// from it. `role: null` is a state that takes no colour at all.
//
// mark: the glyph. word: what it says. role: the theme role its edge and its word take.
// loud: genuinely on you — at most two states may ever be loud, or none of them are.
