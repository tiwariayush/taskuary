This page is the EVIDENCE that pass reads: one dated line per verdict you gave ('Not our task' on this subject from this sender, 'Not a task' on that one) plus notes you type yourself, each tied to a sender, a domain, a subject, or everyone.\n\nWhen a new message arrives, the lines that bear on it (same sender, same topic) ride into triage and into the reply draft, and the model judges how alike the new message really is — the same sender asking the same thing is binding, a shared word is not. The general lessons in LEARNED.md are distilled from these same lines under a stricter rule (LEARNED.md → Verdicts lists which ones fed which lesson).\n\nSo nothing was removed: LEARNED.md is what it concluded, this is what it concluded it from.

Each row stores a hash of its own contents PLUS the hash of the row before it, so the rows form a chain: change any row after the fact — even one character in the database — and its hash no longer matches, and every row after it points at a parent that no longer exists.\n\nVerify recomputes the whole chain from the first row. Intact means the record you see is the record that was written. 'Contents altered' names the exact rows that were changed after writing — the thing this log exists to catch. 'Out of order' means two writers raced at the same instant once; nothing was changed, and it cannot recur.\n\nThe history below is that log, newest first: when, who (you, the router, an agent, a scheduled report), what was done, to what. It is the answer to 'why did this happen' and 'who did this' for anything on the Timeline or the Board." },
