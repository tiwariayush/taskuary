"""A session you opened to work IN must not close itself out from under you.

The self-close judge reads a screen that has gone quiet and decides the run is over. For work
that ARRIVED that is exactly right - somebody is waiting on an answer, and the alternative is a
sender waiting on a human to look at a terminal hours later. For a session the owner opened to
sit in it is the opposite: they alt-tab, the agent stops printing, the judge says finished, and
the task closes with a reply drafted to nobody.

Nothing distinguished the two. selfclose knew the transcript and the clock and nothing about who
had opened the session, so `+ New -> give an agent a job` behaved exactly like a routed email.

The tag says which kind this is. The JUDGE is refused; `taskuary --done` is not - an agent saying
in words that it has finished outranks a guess about who the session was for.
