"""A test run can never reach the owner's real data, whichever way it was started.

tests/conftest.py points TASKUARY_HOME at a temp dir before anything of ours is imported, which
works for `pytest`. It does NOT work for `python tests/test_terminal.py` - every test file here
ends in unittest.main(), and running one directly loads no conftest at all.

That door was open and something went through it: two copies of test_terminal's fixture task
("payroll adjustments post to the wrong month") and its graph:E2E message turned up in the
owner's live database on 2026-09-01, one of them while they were looking at the screen. The same
class of accident on 2026-08-27 cost SOUL.md and left 140 fixture tasks on the board.

So the guard belongs where the decision is made - config.home() - not in a file that only one
entry point loads.
