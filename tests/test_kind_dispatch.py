"""`kind` routes the task, and triage is the only thing that decides it.

Owner, 2026-08-30 (TQ-0253), after a CyberHoot training reminder got a full coder run and a
drafted reply back to the mailer: the exception to everything-goes-to-the-agent is not "an
automated sender", it is "clearly not a coding job" - and it belongs in TRIAGE.md, not in a
hardcoded rule. So there is exactly one gate on the work: coding starts a session, general
lands on the Board and waits for a click. No keyword, sender or category test anywhere else
gets a second opinion.

The training reminder is still a real task - it is due, somebody has to sit the course - it is
just `general`, because no amount of typing does it.
