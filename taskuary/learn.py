"""LEARNED.md - the profile the funnel infers from the owner's verdicts, written by itself.

SOUL.md is what the owner SAYS; LEARNED.md is what they DO. Every explicit correction - a
draft edited before sending, a reply rejected, a task reclassified, a filed message promoted
by hand - carries a general lesson about how this person works: what they are responsible
for, how they write, what deserves a task, who matters. Nobody types those in, so the system
distills them itself. The design follows where the experience-learning literature agrees:
ExpeL's counted insights (arxiv 2308.10144), PRELUDE's infer-the-preference-from-the-edit
(arxiv 2404.15269), Generative Agents' batched reflection with cited evidence (2304.03442).

Two write paths, deliberately different speeds:
- HOT (learn_from): one cheap LLM call per correction turns the single event into a
  hypothesis, visible in the doc seconds after the verdict that taught it - explicit
  corrections are the high-signal minority and deserve immediate weight;
- REFLECTION (reflect / reflect_if_due): batched and debounced, rewrites the whole doc -
  only a batch can see cross-episode patterns, promote hypotheses that kept holding, and
  kill the ones that did not. Implicit signals (drafts approved untouched) are counted
  ONLY here: individually they are noise, in aggregate they are confirmation.

Hypotheses are never injected into prompts: a pattern seen once is a guess, and a guess in
a system prompt is a rule. Only promoted sections travel (injectable()) - and rules whose
effect is to HIDE mail never promote themselves at all: they wait in 'Proposed' for the
owner, because a wrong ignore-rule silences the very corrections that would revoke it.
