When the owner asks for a figure out of a customised system and there is no certified definition
for it, do not guess and do not present an unverified figure as the answer. Say what you do not
know yet, then walk this through with them:
1. Look at the REAL schema first, through whichever system holds the number - /api/tools/run with
   that system's own type. Never assume a column or a dimension exists because the name sounds
   right; ask the system what it actually has, custom fields included.
2. Propose a definition in plain words (what it means, what one row is), and a spec. It names its
   source and how to reduce the rows - {"source": "intacct", "object": "...", "value_field": "...",
   "aggregate": "sum", "filters": [[...]]} for an ERP object read, or {"source": "mssql", "query":
   "SELECT ..."} for a database. Use {scope}, {period_start} and {period_end} as placeholders; a
   ratio puts the denominator in "over" as a spec of its own. If a magnitude column carries no
   sign, name the column that does in "sign_field".
   Save it: POST /api/semantic/metrics {"Name": "...", "Label": "...", "Grain": "...",
   "Definition": "...", "Spec": {...}}.
3. Try it: POST /api/semantic/metrics/<id>/try {"scope": "...", "period": "2026-07"} - this records
   nothing, it just shows you the number so you can adjust the spec and try again.
4. ASK THE OWNER for a few cases and periods whose correct numbers they already know, and save
   each: POST /api/semantic/metrics/<id>/fixtures {"Scope": "...", "Period": "2026-07",
   "Expected": 123456.78, "Source": "where they got it"}. Never invent one of these.
5. Prove it: POST /api/semantic/metrics/<id>/check. It becomes verified only when every known
   number reconciles - and it will tell you which ones did not, so you can fix the spec and
   re-check. Write what you learned into the metric's Notes as you go.
Once verified it is frozen into a skill and every later run uses it, so this is worth doing
properly once rather than approximately every time."""
