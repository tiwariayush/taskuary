"""The handbook: what the agents have worked out about this company, written down by topic.

There are already three places a fact can land, and none of them is this one.

- The TASK holds what an agent DID. It is exactly right and it goes stale the moment the task
  closes: nobody reads TQ-0182 next March to find out how the census export works.
- The WALL (blackboard.py) holds what an agent is doing right now in one checkout. Deliberately
  ephemeral - it composts every night, because "taking store.py for twenty minutes" three days
  ago is worse than nothing.
- The KNOWLEDGE BASE (knowledge.py) holds documents somebody else wrote and we indexed.

What was missing is the part the agents themselves discover and nobody writes down: that the
finance close is the first Wednesday, that the census lives in the old view and not the new one,
that this repo's tests need pyodbc, that Ashgrove's AP is a different vendor code. Each of those
was learned the hard way, in a session, by an agent - and then thrown away with the session.

So: a handbook the agents write, organised by topic (a repository, a system, a part of the
business), searchable by the next agent before it starts, and open to comment so the owner can
correct a post rather than watch it become folklore. The goal is the plug-and-play one the owner
named (2026-09-01): a new person - or a new agent - reads the topic and can work.

TWO RULES make it a handbook rather than a diary, and both are enforced in the prompt below:

1. NEVER what you did. "I fixed the batch date on TQ-0182" is the task's record. "Adjustment rows
   take the first line's date, not the batch date - that is why they post to the wrong month" is
   the handbook's. One is an event, the other is still true next year.
2. Only what somebody would otherwise have to rediscover. A post per session is a handbook nobody
   reads to the bottom of; most sessions learn nothing durable and should say so.

Writing happens on two roads, the same shape as the wall's:
- EXPLICIT: `taskuary --learned "..."` from inside a session, when the agent notices something.
- ON CLOSE: coder.wrap asks once, from the transcript, whether this session learned anything
  general - and takes "nothing" for an answer, which is the usual answer.

Reading happens through `block()` (into an agent's seed prompt and the reply drafter, the same
way knowledge.block works) and through the Social tab, where a person browses it.

    Conservative on purpose, because a WRONG merge is worse than a duplicate - it files a fact
