"""What still needs doing before Taskuary can actually work, derived from real state.

The app has never said what "set up" means. A fresh install opens on an empty Timeline that
looks exactly like a working install with a quiet morning, and the three things standing between
those two states - who you are, an AI that can read a message, somewhere for messages to arrive
from - are on three different tabs with nothing pointing at them.

Nothing here is a stored checklist that could drift out of step with the truth: every step reads
the same tables the funnel reads, so a step is done when the thing it asks for actually works,
and un-does itself if the connection is removed.
