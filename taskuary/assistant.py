"""The assistant on the Timeline: a check every 30 minutes, a post only when it has something to say.

Triage judges each message as it arrives and then nothing ever spoke up later - the reply the
owner sent on Monday and never heard back on, the meeting in two hours with five mails of
history behind it, the task that went quiet. This is the voice that does: on its own clock it gathers what the hub can see
(followups: the owner wrote last and asked for something; prep: meetings ahead, with what came
before them; cold: work nothing has touched; and its own ideas
from the day's mail), asks the model for its read GIVEN WHAT IT ALREADY SAID, and posts only what
is new as ONE row on the Timeline. The owner can talk back to every line; a correction or question
gets an answer and becomes context for later checks. A concrete suggestion may also offer Follow up
(the chase is drafted in Review) or Make it a task.

It never repeats itself: every idea has a key and a state (idea table). Said once with the same
facts is said; dismissed stays dismissed until the facts change; snoozed sleeps. Those legacy states
remain understood, but the panel asks the owner to explain what is wrong instead of exposing opaque verdict buttons.

Nothing sits pinned above the Timeline: the assistant IS its rows, each posted for something
specific, and what is open, in flight and waiting on the owner is the Morning digest's job on its
own clock (the owner, 2026-08-30: the status strip with its counts and 'ask now' was noise). The
thresholds and the producers are settings (assistant_*); the clock and the instruction are the
'Assistant' report on the Reports tab.

What it READS decides what it can say (the owner, 2026-08-30: "keep iterating from prompt to the data
it brings in until it says something useful and surprising"). Handed only subject lines and counts it
wrote 'no content given' in its own notes; so the check now reads WHAT PEOPLE SAID (the words of every
human thread of the last two days, the owner's lines marked), who is OUT OF OFFICE (from auto-replies -
a chase to someone away is worse than silence), the CALENDAR, and the actual words in every rolled-up
arrival (including machine mail), with each report's schedule and each failure's cause beside the count. That is where "Yittie said exporting freezes the
app - and she is in Monday's meeting" comes from.

It also leaves itself a NOTE: each check ends with what it looked at and found nothing in, when
something becomes worth raising, whatever it would otherwise work out again - and the next check
starts by reading it (assistant_notes). Half-hourly checks are cheap only if each one does not
start from zero; a quiet check still rewrites the note, it just posts nothing. How it SPEAKS is
COUNSEL.md (Docs tab) - the owner edits that to change its voice and what it takes a position on;
the report's prompt is what it watches for.

    'have not connected, or names the one thing I am about to miss. Read, in this order of worth:\n'
    '0. CONFIGURED SYSTEM CHECKS - current views from finance, operations, CRM, infrastructure, or any other connected system. '
    'Look for threshold breaches, unusual totals, sharp changes, missing expected activity, and facts that conflict across systems.\n'
    '1. WHAT PEOPLE SAID - the actual words, by thread. The ask buried in a chat ("can you fill out the form?") that got a '
    'reply but not the thing itself; the colleague mentioning in passing that a system fails "every day 4-5"; the person '
    'answering a question nobody asked me; the thread where the last word is theirs and it wants something from me. Say who, '
    'what, and what I would do - "Marcus asked for X on Thursday; I would send it before his Monday 1pm".\n'
    '2. What I am waiting on and have not chased (CANDIDATES followup) - but check OUT OF OFFICE first: a chase to someone '
    'who is away is worse than silence; say when they are back instead.\n'
    '3. What I promised and have not done (promise): the date I gave, and whether it has passed.\n'
    '4. CALENDAR: for each meeting in the next two days, what in the mail and chats bears on it - the person in the room '
    'who asked me something this week, the thread it will be about. A recurring standup with nothing behind it needs no line.\n'
    '5. Work gone quiet (cold): push it or drop it - say which.\n'
    '6. What the machines are telling me, read not counted: a report marked FAILED says WHY (the error is in the line) - name '
    'the cause; a job that fails the same way N times is one finding, with the cause; a report whose every run says "0 rows" '
    'is a report nobody needs. Reports carry their schedule: "on app start" firing 20 times means the app was started 20 '
    'times, not that the scheduler is broken.\n'

    'process change worth proposing. Name the evidence: TQ-ref, count, sender. Never restate what I did.\n'
    'Be useful, not busy: a check with nothing NEW posts nothing, and most checks are that. When you do speak, prefer the '
    'specific over the general: a name, a date, a quoted phrase, a cause. One idea about my own work a day is right; three is '
    'noise. Never repeat anything under ALREADY SAID, reworded or not - but a fact that CHANGES an earlier line (they are out '
    'of office; the failure has a cause; they answered) is new and worth one line.\n'

# what they are working on, then things you forgot to follow up from last week, then some stats".

# own state, which is the whole value of them - they are just SORTED into sections that say what
# kind of thing you are looking at.

# Two of the sections are not the model's work at all. What is in flight and what the day counted
# are FACTS the hub already holds, and asking a model to restate them is how a brief starts
# inventing a task that is not there (the digest did exactly that: TQ-0032 "pending review" when
# nothing was pending). So they are computed here and the model never sees them as its own output.
